A dozen financial companies, including BlackRock, Blackstone and KKR, now list anti-ESG efforts as a risk in their annual reports, the Financial Times recently reported.State of play: Anti-ESG forces are in full swing this proxy season — the time of year when public companies host their annual meetings, and shareholders vote on a slate of investor proposals. Investors have filed 68 anti-ESG proposals this year to date — compared to 45 in all of 2022, per data from the Sustainable Investments Institute, a nonprofit. About one-third of the anti-ESG proposals this year are focused on diversity — asking companies, including Apple, JPMorgan, Coca-Cola and McDonald's, to report on the ""risks"" that their anti-discrimination or racial justice efforts pose to their business.Two proposals ask companies to avoid public policy positions unless there's a business justification. And a handful are asking public companies to report the risks posed by attempting to achieve net zero or decarbonization goals.What they're saying: ""Companies should be prepared to deal with ESG backlash,"" the Conference Board warned in its recent proxy season preview. The big picture: Historically, anti-ESG proposals like these have failed. ""There's a lot of attention and noise but nobody supports this stuff,"" said Heidi Welsh, executive director of the Sustainable Investments Institute. Zoom in: Financial services companies, in particular, are in retreat. ""I think all of them are a lot more careful since the Republicans are so vocal about this,"" a source who is close to the financial industry tells Axios.   ""Whenever there is a possible conflict coming, the shutters go down,"" the source said. For example, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink didn't mention the term ESG anywhere in his most recent investor letter, a departure from those of the past several years, as Axios' Andrew Freedman reported. Vanguard dropped out of a global climate initiative at the end of 2022.BP earlier this year backed off some of its more ambitious climate goals, the Washington Post reported.Between the lines: Companies are soldiering on with diversity or climate initiatives they think are important — or good for business — but they're just less willing to talk about it.Worth noting: The retreat isn't simply about anti-ESG efforts. Businesses are also more inclined to stay mum as regulators like the SEC start paying more attention to companies' ESG-related claims.The bottom line: ESG efforts aren't going away, but you might see fewer press releases and puff pieces about the issue.

A new case study by impak Analytics reveals the global impact of Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft








Doubts on ESG ratings' trustworthiness
Among the Big Tech companies, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet have some of the best ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) scores on the planet. According to Yahoo Finance, they hold 7th, 3rd and 1st place, respectively, among the Top 12 ESG companies of 2022. However, their impact analysis on ESG factors shows an unexpected conclusion. After analyzing Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft with an impact approach, each has an impak Score™ lower than 200 points out of 1,000, making them average rather than leaders. To put things in perspective, the average impak Score™ of impak's large-cap universe is 145 out of 1,000 points, with best-in-class scores above 400. The impact approach to answer investors' needs""Assessing the global impact of a company requires a holistic analysis [...], and the traditional financial metrics alone provide neither a complete nor a comprehensive picture of a company's impact. A narrow focus may be detrimental to achieving the United Nations's 17 Sustainable Development Goals or investor returns in the long run.""The study intends to demonstrate (i) why the ESG approach appears to have yet to adequately assess the global impact of the three companies, (ii) the extent to which the consideration of Apple, Alphabet & Microsoft's numerous and severe controversies is crucial to the understanding of the sustainability-oriented investor, and (iii) why their mitigation of negative impacts does not equate to a positive impact. The tipping point of sustainable financeGoing beyond the financial materiality of ESG assessment, the analysis shows that Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft fail to be the real proponents of sustainability. We are at a pivotal moment for non-financial reporting and as shown in the study, the market has all the tools, theories and data to prevent further misleading ESG ratings on large-cap companies.A must-read for any investor wishing to avoid reputational risks and to make a measurable impact on both people and the planet. Download the full report To learn more about impak, visit www.impakanalytics.com/about-us/Source: Impact statements of Alphabet, Apple and MicrosoftMedia ContactStéphanie Bernier-Monzon[email protected] +1 438 886 8796Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2042962/impak_Ratings_case_study.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2014430/3959215/impak_analytics_Logo.jpgSOURCE impak Ratings
